# **Ballon Frenzy** 
## Introduction 
> **T**his game is our take on a "simcade" video game. We incorporated a typical static ballon game, and added Physics to it!

> Enjoy! and Protect That Ballon.

## Outline: 
### Out game is a 3D Ballon Shooter Survival Game where you protect your ballon from falling objects. These objects will try to pop the ballon and as the player, you will control a cannon to stop those objects. Our entire premise of our game is to be a ballon survival. 
- We envision our user’s to have a interesting and fun experience with a bit of humor to it. We want our players to feel attached to this ballon and will try everything in their power to save it. Finally, we wanted to stand out from all other survival games out there.
- The larger vision of our game is to add a physic based system to create a simcade survival game.
