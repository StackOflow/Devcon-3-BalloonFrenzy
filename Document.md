# **Balloon Frenzy** 
## Introduction 
> **T**his game is our take on a "simcade" video game. We incorporated a typical static ballon game, and added Physics to it!

> Enjoy! and Protect That Ballon.

## Outline: 
### Out game is a 3D Balloon Shooter Survival Game where you protect your ballon from falling objects. These objects will try to pop the ballon and as the player, you will control a cannon to stop those objects. Our entire premise of our game is to be a balloon survival. 
- We envision our user’s to have a interesting and fun experience with a bit of humor to it. We want our players to feel attached to this ballon and will try everything in their power to save it. Finally, we wanted to stand out from all other survival games out there.
- The larger vision of our game is to add a physic based system to create a simcade survival game.

## Map Layout 
### The layout of our game is a Long Box with the cannon and the ballon being at the bottom, and debris comming from the top. You play as a **Cannon** defending the **Ballon** from **_Debris._** Our game was designed soley for PC/Laptop interface. Our soundtrack is to have a _fun day adventure_ vibe as the players feel without a care in the world.

# Playtest Questions
For our playtest, we had three questions for our peers to answer regarding our prototype:
1. _Did our game incorporated physics? How so?_
2. _What Part of our game did you like? vs Did not?_
3. _What feedback would you give?_

# Feedback
- _Speed of the firing force of the cannon could be faster_
- _Slow down the gravity of the falling objects_
- _Lower the color intensity of the win and loss screen_
- _Have the game be more on theme with the Christmas design we're going for_
